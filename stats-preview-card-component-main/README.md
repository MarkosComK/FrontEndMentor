## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned


I was able to improve my overall organization in code, including styles position in css. Some concepts are still hard to understand like flex and grid, but projects like this work these concepts very well. 

Still having dificults to choose measures as you can see below. But always improving.

```css
.card{
    min-width: 329px;
    max-width: 400px;
    display: flex;
    background-color: white;
    margin: 23px;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    border-radius: 15px;
}

.card h1{
    margin: 1.7rem;
    font-size: 1.4rem;
    color: hsl(223, 47%, 23%);
}
.card .info p{
    padding: 0px 40px 30px;
    font-size: 0.9rem;
}
```



### Continued development

I've done this challenge in the beginning of september. All challenges i do, i post on github to see how i'm improving my skills. Visit my repo's on github to see more.
