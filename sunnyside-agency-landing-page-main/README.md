## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

The most important part of this project for me it's the mobile navbar with an hamburguer menu; that's my first contact with JavaScript in a project and i think i do well. I'm proud of me. But i'm not too sure about the quality of my JS code, but i'm still workin on it.

Some code snippets from my navbar:

```html
  <nav>
      <div class="logo">sunnyside</div>
      <ul class="nav-links">
        <li><a class="navlink" href="#section1">About</a></li>
        <li><a class="navlink" href="#section3">Services</a></li>
        <li><a class="navlink" href="#section4">Project</a></li>
        <li><a class="navlink" href="#contact"><span>Contact</span></a></li>
      </ul>
      <img class="hamburguer" src="images/icon-hamburger.svg" alt="hamburguer navigation menu">
  </nav>
```


```js
/*quando clicar no .hamburguer mostrar o nav*/

const navShow = () => {
    const hamburguer = document.querySelector('.hamburguer')
    const nav = document.querySelector('.nav-links')

    hamburguer.addEventListener('click', () => {
        nav.classList.toggle('show-nav')
    })

    nav.addEventListener('click', () => {
        nav.classList.toggle('show-nav')
    })

}

navShow()

```


### Continued development

Depending on the date you're reading this, i'm still working on this project. I want to make a different navber with a better UX for mobile devices and make some animations at sides of the page for ultra-wide monitors (like a feature). I love interative pages, that's why i want to add more interactivety
