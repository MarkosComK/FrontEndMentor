## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use SASS to better organize the code and improve its future modification. Improved use of html divs and tags and flexbox behavior.

Below is the format i used to organize the colors with SASS. This project is my first contact with this kind of use of CSS


```css
$orange: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
$cyan: hsl(184, 100%, 22%);
$darkcyan2: hsl(179, 100%, 13%);
$white: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
$gray: hsl(0, 0%, 95%);
```


### Continued development

This front-end-mentor project may not be finished, but I will work on it until I complete it masterfully before moving on to another one.
